Please read the file as a DataFrame from [here](assests/datasets/QSR.csv). This is the Dining satisfaction with quick service restaurants questionare data provided by Dr. Siri McDowall, supported by DART SEED grant.

1. Please pick out all rating columns. Excluding `last.visit`, `visit.again` and `recommend`, compute the mean of the rest and add it to the DataFrame as a new column.
2. Use a plot to show the relations among these four columns:  `last.visit`, `visit.again`, `recommend` and `mean`.
3. Look at the column `Profession`. Keep `Student`, and change everything else to be `Professional`, and add it as a new column `Status` to the DataFrame.
4. Draw the histogram of `mean` with respect to `Status`.
5. Find the counts of each `recommend` rating for each `Status` and draw the barplot. Do the same to `last.visit`/`Status` and `visit.again`/`Status`.
6. Explore the dataset and draw one plot.
