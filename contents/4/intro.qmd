# Package: `pandas`
The basic data structure for `pandas` is `pandas.DataFrame`. You may treat it as a generalized version of tables.

To use `pandas`, we just import it. In most cases you would like to use the alias `pd`.
```{python}
#| eval: false
import pandas as pd
```




Since `DataFrame` is more like a table, the biggest questions here is not to do computations (which is still very important), but to retrieve, search, sort, merge, etc.. those data.
